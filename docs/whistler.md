### NCPI Whistler via Docker
I have put together a docker image and a set of scripts that allows users to simply build a docker image and copy some basic shell scripts that handle the docker calls for you, allowing you to run the exact same commands as you would using the regular python application suite. That can be found [here](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/dockerized-whistler)

This image contains both the whistler program as well as the entire NCPI Whistler tool suite, providing everything you need to get started in a single, easy to install package.
