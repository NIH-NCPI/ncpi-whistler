"""
Data-Dictionary representation classes to help simplify the interface from 
various parts of whistler to the underlying data-dictionary information. 

Until now, data-dictionaries have always been flat, CSV files. However, 
moving forward, we will support other formats as well including JSON and
it should be straight forward to add new formats without touching the 
interface with whistler itself.
